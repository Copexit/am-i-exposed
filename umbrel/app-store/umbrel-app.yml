description: >-
  Am I Exposed? is a free, client-side Bitcoin privacy analysis tool that
  grades your transactions and addresses using 16 chain analysis heuristics -
  the same techniques used by surveillance firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic.


  Paste any Bitcoin address or transaction ID and get a privacy score from
  0 to 100 with a letter grade (A+ to F) and specific, actionable findings.


  When running on Umbrel, all blockchain API requests are routed through your
  local mempool instance - no third-party APIs, no data leaks, maximum privacy.

  - 12 transaction-level and 4 address-level privacy heuristics

  - CoinJoin detection (Whirlpool, WabiSabi, JoinMarket)

  - Boltzmann entropy estimation

  - Wallet fingerprinting and change detection
